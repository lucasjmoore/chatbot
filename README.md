sessionId: "<36 character sessionID>"
  };`

For MongoDB you must create a folder `C:\data\db`

You also need to include Mongo in your PATH variable

Have two command line terminals open and navigate to the chatbot folder in both.

In the first terminal run `npm install` to install the NodeJS modules.

Then run `mongod` to start MongoDB.

In the second terminal run `npm start`

Check to see if your chatbot works

In your browser navigate to `localhost:3000`

You should see the chatbot up and running!
